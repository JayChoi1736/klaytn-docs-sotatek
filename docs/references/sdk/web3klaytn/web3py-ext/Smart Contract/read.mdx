You can call functions in Smart Contract via "Call" RPC API. What you can call here is limited to **view functions** that is not changing any states in the Contract.

```py smart_contract_interaction.py
from web3py_ext import extend
from web3 import Web3

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net'))

def contract_interaction():
    c = w3.eth.contract(
      address="0x95Be48607498109030592C08aDC9577c7C2dD505",
      abi = [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"initNumber","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":False,"inputs":[{"indexed":False,"internalType":"uint256","name":"number","type":"uint256"}],"name":"SetNumber","type":"event"},{"inputs":[],"name":"increment","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"number","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"newNumber","type":"uint256"}],"name":"setNumber","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]

Import web3 to interact with smart contract
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=1:2

```
---
Create a web3 instance using RPC endpoint and web3 library
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=4

```
---
create a contract instance with contract address and abi
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=7:10

```
---
Define contract address
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=8

```
---
Define contract ABI
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=9

```
---
Call the function in the ABI using the contract created
```py smart_contract_interaction.py focus=11:12

```
